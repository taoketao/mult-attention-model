- use virtual environment venv for proper matplotlib version (ie > 1.3.1)
- use ipython to workaround reinstalling tensorflow in the virtualenv
- note: no docker available.

Both mram.py and ram.py are changed in this directory. In directory <RAM>, the 
ram.py is unchanged.

- UPDATE: moved mram.py to _mram.py and have new mram2.py.  This new mram2.py
will output [MANY!] images with the name meant for saving session in ./summary
The overhaul will occur here.
